# Getting Started with Git

# Preparation for Meetup

  1. Install the Git software appropriate for your operating system.
  1. Install a code editor.  
     If you have an editor you already use and like, keep using it.  
     Otherwise, these are couple of popular (and free) choices worth checking out:
     - [VS Code][vscode]
     - [Atom][atom]
  1. Sign up for an account on [GitHub](https://github.com).


## Windows

Download and install [Git for Windows][git_windows] (includes Bash).

## Mac OS X

Install [Homebrew][mac_homebrew].  After you have homebrew installed update to the latest version of Git:

    $ brew install git

## Linux

I trust you already know how to install software on your linux system :)


# Step 1: Git Configuration

*This is where we'll jump in at the Meetup.*
